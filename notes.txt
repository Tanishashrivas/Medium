- in blogs file:  data is static + table has very less fields, we gota fix that
- supabase and google auth and check whether email even exists or not.
- expand tables like date, minutes read and other things
- Profile dropdown: change signup title in nav to profile and dropdown.
- published option in blog?
- dynamic like, share, comment: we need to make tables and relations between them, endpoints, and then fetch them.
